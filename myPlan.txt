RULES:
- All math must be implemented in the server
- calculation history must be in server
- client code must ask server for calculation history and apply to dom
- get new calculation data from user input

---Things to-do CLIENT SIDE----
- use a get request to display history into section with data id of "resultHistory"
- use a get request to display the most recent calculation to a section with data id of "recentResult"
- when the = button is clicked, post an object to /calculations

---HTML---
- within the calculator form, make an interface to interact with (numbers and operators and clear)

---TO-DO SERVER SIDE---
- create a get route for /calculations to send the calculations array back to the client
    array is formated as follows
      [
    {
      numOne: 3,
      numTwo: 5,
      operator: '+',
      result: 8
    },
    {
      numOne: 11,
      numTwo: 7,
      operator: '-',
      result: 4
    }
  ]
